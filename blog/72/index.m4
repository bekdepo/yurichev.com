_HEADER_HL1(`15-Mar-2013: Quick introduction to reverse engineering for beginners')

<p>In first half of 2010, I wrote small notes about reverse engineering for beginners, now I got some spare time to gather them all, illustrate them, rewrite to LaTeX, etc.</p>

<p>So it's now 210-220 pages book in PDF form, both in English and Russian languages.</p>

<p>It's yet unfull and contain a lot of incorrect clauses and mistakes.</p>
