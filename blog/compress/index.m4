<p>All these files are genuine, kernel.org website hasn't been compromised, and you can download, find these strings, check signatures.</p>

<p>Now seriously.</p>

<p>It's a nice illustration of _HTML_LINK(`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia',`apophenia') and _HTML_LINK(`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia',`pareidolia')
(human's mind ability to see faces in clouds, etc) in Lurkmore, Russian counterpart of Encyclopedia Dramatica.
As _HTML_LINK(`http://lurkmore.to/%D0%AD%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D1%84%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD',`they wrote') in the article
about <i>electronic voice phenomenon</i>,
you can open any long enough compressed file in hex editor and find well-known 3-letter Russian obscene word, and you'll find it a lot: but that means nothing, just a mere coincidence.</p>

<p>And I was interested in calculation, how big compressed file must be to contain all possible 3-letter, 4-letter, etc, words?
In my naive calculations, I've got this: probability of the first specific byte in the middle of compressed data stream with maximal entropy is $\frac{1}{256}$, probability of the 2nd is also $\frac{1}{256}$,
and probability of specific byte pair is $\frac{1}{256 \cdot 256} = \frac{1}{256^2}$.
Probabilty of specific triple is $\frac{1}{256^3}$.
If the file has maximal entropy (which is unachievable, but...) and we live in an ideal world, you've got to have a file of size just $256^3=16777216$, which is 16-17MB.
You can check: get any compressed file, and use <i>rafind2</i> to search for any 3-letter word (not just that Russian obscene one).<p>

<p>It took ~8-9 GB of my downloaded movies/TV series files to find the word "beer" in them (case sensitive).
Perhaps, these movies wasn't compressed good enough?
This is also true for a well-known 4-letter English obscene word.
</p>

<p>My approach is naive, so I googled for mathematically grounded one, and have find this question:
_HTML_LINK(`http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/27989/time-until-a-consecutive-sequence-of-ones-in-a-random-bit-sequence/27991#27991',`Time until a consecutive sequence of ones in a random bit sequence').
The answer is: $(p^{−n}−1)/(1−p)$, where $p$ is probability of each event and $n$ is number of consecutive events.
Plug $\frac{1}{256}$ and $3$ and you'll get almost the same as my naive calculations.</p>

<p>So any 3-letter words can be found in the compressed file (with ideal entropy) of length $256^3=~17MB$, any 4-letter word - $256^4=4.7GB$ (size of DVD).
Any 5-letter word - $256^5=~1TB$.</p>

<p>For the post you are reading now, I mirrored the whole _HTML_LINK(`https://www.kernel.org/',`kernel.org') website (hopefully, sysadmins can forgive me),
and it has ~430GB of compressed Linux Kernel source trees.
It has enough compressed data to contain these words, however, I cheated a bit: I searched for both lowercase and uppercase strings, thus compressed data set I need is almost halved.</p>

<p>This is quite interesting thing to think about: 1TB of compressed data with maximal entropy has all possible 5-byte chains,
but the data is encoded not in chains itself, but in the order of chains (no matter of compression algorithm, etc).</p>

<p>Now the information for gamblers: one should throw a dice ~42 times to get a pair of six, but no one will tell you, when exactly.
I don't remember, how many times coin was tossed in the "Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead" movie, but one should toss it ~2048 times and at some point, you'll get 10 heads,
and at some other point, 10 tails. Again, no one will tell you, when exactly this will happen.</p>

<p>Compressed data can also be treated as a random stream, so we can use the same mathematics to determine probabilities, etc.</p>

<p>If you can live with strings of mixed case, like "bEeR", probabilities and compressed data sets are much lower:
$128^3=2MB$ for all 3-letter words of mixed case,
$128^4=268MB$ for all 4-letter words,
$128^5=34GB$ for all 5-letter words, etc.
</p>

<p>Moral of the story: whenever you search for some patterns, you can find it in the middle of compressed blob, but that means nothing else then coincidence.
In philosophical sense, this is a case of _HTML_LINK(`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias',`selection')/_HTML_LINK(`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias',`confirmation bias'): you find what you search for
(_HTML_LINK(`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel',`The Library of Babel') in micro sense).</p>
