_HEADER_HL1(`3-Jul-2013: "Quick introduction to reverse engineering for beginners" book update')

<p>Not much added to my "Quick introduction to reverse engineering for beginners" book, but couple things: how C++ objects are usually represented in low-level x86 code and also several examples related to Oracle RDBMS: how to find all information about V$\$$TIMER view and X$\$$KSMLRU tables, which functions are behind them, etc (section 7.3).</p>

<p>I also wrote small utility to extract information related to V$\$$ views and X$\$$ tables, <a href="//yurichev.com/oracle_tables.html">it's here</a>. But more about is in my "book".</p>
