_HEADER_HL1(`13-May-2015: (Beginners level) Analyzing unknown binary files using information entropy.')

_COPYPASTED1()

<p>For the sake of simplification, I would say, information entropy is a measure, how tightly some piece of data can be compressed.
For example, it is usually not possible to compress already compressed archive file, so it has high entropy.
On the other hand, one megabyte of zero bytes can be compressed to a tiny output file.
Indeed, in plain English language, one million of zeroes can be described just as "resulting file is one million zero bytes".
Compressed files are usually a list of instructions to decompressor, like this: "put 1000 zeroes, then 0x23 byte, then 0x45 byte, then put a block of size 10 bytes which we've seen 500 bytes back, etc".</p>

<p>Texts written in natural languages are also can be compressed tightly, 
because natural languages has a lot of redundancy
(otherwise, a tiny typo will always lead to misunderstanding, 
like any toggled bit in compressed archive make decompression nearly impossible), 
some words are used very often, etc.
It's possible to drop some words and text will be still readable.</p>

<p>Code for CPUs is also can be compressed, because some ISA instructions are used much more often than others.
In x86, most used instructions are MOV/PUSH/CALL -- indeed, most of the time, computer CPU is just shuffling data and switching between
levels of abstractions.
If to consider data shuffling as moving data between levels of abstractions, this is also part of switching.</p>

<p>Data compressors and encryptors tend to produce very high entropy results.
Good pseudorandom number generators also produce data which cannot be compressed 
(it is possible to measure their quality by this sign).</p>

<p>So, in other words, entropy is a measure which can help to probe unknown data block.
Even more than that, it is possible to slice some file by blocks, probe each and draw a graph.
I did this in Wolfram Mathematica for demonstration and here is a source code (Mathematica 10):</p>

_PRE_BEGIN
(* loading the file *)
input=BinaryReadList["file.bin"];

(* setting block sizes *)
BlockSize=4096;BlockSizeToShow=256;

(* slice blocks by 4k *)
blocks=Partition[input,BlockSize];

(* how many blocks we've got? *)
Length[blocks]

(* calculate entropy for each block. 2 in Entropy[] (base) is set with the intention so Entropy[] 
function will produce the same results as Linux ent utility does *)
entropies=Map[N[Entropy[2,#]]&,blocks];

(* helper functions *)
fBlockToShow[input_,offset_]:=Take[input,{1+offset,1+offset+BlockSizeToShow}]
fToASCII[val_]:=FromCharacterCode[val,"PrintableASCII"]
fToHex[val_]:=IntegerString[val,16]
fPutASCIIWindow[data_]:=Framed[Grid[Partition[Map[fToASCII,data],16]]]
fPutHexWindow[data_]:=Framed[Grid[Partition[Map[fToHex,data],16],Alignment->Right]]

(* that will be the main knob here *)
{Slider[Dynamic[offset],{0,Length[input]-BlockSize,BlockSize}],Dynamic[BaseForm[offset,16]]}

(* main UI part *)
Dynamic[{ListLinePlot[entropies,GridLines->{{-1,offset/BlockSize,1}},Filling->Axis,AxesLabel->{"offset","entropy"}],
CurrentBlock=fBlockToShow[input,offset];
fPutHexWindow[CurrentBlock],
fPutASCIIWindow[CurrentBlock]}]

_HL2(`GeoIP ISP database:')

<p>Let's start with the <a href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo">GeoIP</a> file (which assigns ISP to the block of IP addresses).
This binary file (<i>GeoIPISP.dat</i>) has some tables (which are IP address ranges perhaps) plus some text blob at the end of the file
(containing ISP names).</p>

<p>When I load it to Mathematica, I see this:</p>

<img src="geoipisp1.png">

<p>There are two parts in graph: first is somewhat chaotic, second is more steady.</p>

<p>0 in horizontal axis in graph mean lowest entropy (the data which can be compressed very tightly, "ordered" in other words) 
and 8 is highest (cannot be compressed at all, "chaotic" or "random" in other words).
Why 0 and 8? 0 mean 0 bits per byte (byte slot is not filled at all) 
and 8 mean 8 bits per byte, i.e., the whole byte slot is filled with the information tightly.</p>

<p>So I put slider to point in the middle of the first block, and I clearly see some array of 32-bit integers.
Now I put slider in the middle of the second block and I see English text:</p>

<img src="geoipisp2.png">

<p>Indeed, this are names of ISPs.
So, entropy of English text is 4.5-5.5 bits per byte? Yes, something like this.
Wolfram Mathematica has some well-known English literature corpus embedded, and we can see entropy of Shakespeare's sonnets:</p>

_PRE_BEGIN
In[]:= Entropy[2,ExampleData[{"Text","ShakespearesSonnets"}]]//N
Out[]= 4.42366
_PRE_END

<p>4.4 is close to what we've got (4.7-5.3). 
Of course, classic English literature texts are somewhat different from ISP names and other English texts we can find in binary files 
(debugging/logging/error messages), but this value is close.</p>

_HL2(`TP-Link WR941 firmware:')

<p>Now more complex example. I've got firmware for TP-Link WR941 router:</p>

<img src="tplink.png">

<p>Wee see here 3 blocks with empty lacunas.
The first block (started at address 0) is small, second (address somewhere at 0x22000) is bigger and third (address 0x123000) is biggest.
I can't be sure about exact entropy of the first block, but 2nd and 3rd has very high entropy, meaning that these blocks are either
compressed and/or encrypted.<p>

<p>I tried <a href="http://binwalk.org/">binwalk</a> for this firmware file:</p>

_PRE_END

<p>Indeed: there are some stuff at the beginning, but two large LZMA compressed blocks are started at 0x20400 and 0x120200.
These are roughly addresses we have seen in Mathematica.
Oh, and by the way, binwalk can show entropy information as well (-E option):</p>

3727360       0x38E000        Falling entropy edge (0.732390)
_PRE_END

<p>Rising edges are corresponding to rising edges of block on our graph.
Falling edges are the points where empty lacunas are started.</p>

<p>I didn't able to force binwalk to generate PNG graphs (due to absence of some Python library), but here is an example how binwalk
can do them: _HTML_LINK_AS_IS(`http://binwalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/lg_dtv.png').</p>

<p>What can we say about lacunas? By looking in hex editor, we see that these are just filled with 0xFF bytes.
Why developers put them? Perhaps, because they didn't able to calculate precise compressed blocks sizes, so they allocated space
for them with some reserve.</p>

_HL2(`Notepad:')

<p>Another example is notepad.exe I've picked in Windows 8.1:</p>

<img src="notepad1.png">

<p>There is cavity at ~0x19000 (absolute file offset).
I opened the executable file in hex editor and found imports table there (which has lower entropy than x86-64 code
in the first half of graph).</p>

<p>There are also high entropy block started at ~0x20000:</p>

<img src="notepad2.png">

<p>In hex editor I can see PNG file here, embedded in the PE file resource section (it is a large image of notepad icon).
PNG files are compressed, indeed.</p>

_HL2(`Unnamed dashcam:')

<p>Now the most complex example in this article is the firmware of some unnamed dashcam I've received from friend:</p>

<img src="dashcam_text.png">

<p>The cavity at the very beginning is a English text: debugging messages.
I checked various ISAs and I found that 
the first third of the whole file (with the text segment inside) is in fact MIPS (little-endian) code!</p>

<p>For instance, this is very distinctive MIPS function epilogue:</p>

_PRE_BEGIN
ROM:000013B0                 move    $sp, $fp
ROM:000013B4                 lw      $ra, 0x1C($sp)
ROM:000013B8                 lw      $fp, 0x18($sp)
ROM:000013BC                 lw      $s1, 0x14($sp)
ROM:000013C0                 lw      $s0, 0x10($sp)
ROM:000013C4                 jr      $ra
ROM:000013C8                 addiu   $sp, 0x20
_PRE_END

<p>From our graph we can see that MIPS code has entropy of 5-6 bits per byte.
Indeed, I once measured various ISAs entropy and I've got these values:</p>

<ul>
<li> x86: .text section of ntoskrnl.exe file from Windows 2003: 6.6
<li> x64: .text section of ntoskrnl.exe file from Windows 7 x64: 6.5
<li> ARM (thumb mode), Angry Birds Classic: 7.05
<li> ARM (ARM mode) Linux Kernel 3.8.0: 6.03
<li> MIPS (little endian), .text section of user32.dll from Windows NT 4: 6.09
</ul>

<p>So the entropy of executable code is higher than of English text, but still can be compressed.</p>

<p>Now the second third is started at 0xF5000. I don't know what this is. I tried different ISAs but without success.
The entropy of the block is looks even steadier than for executable one.
Maybe some kind of data?</p>

<p>There is also a spike at ~0x213000. I checked it in hex editor and I found JPEG file there 
(which, of course, compressed)!
I also don't know what is at the end.
Let's try binwalk for this file:</p>

<p>Yes, it found JPEG file and even MySQL data!
But I'm not sure if it's true -- I didn't checked it yet.</p>

<p>It's also interesting to try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">clusterization</a> in Mathematica:</p>

<img src="dashcam_clusters.png">

<p>Here is an example of how Mathematica grouped various entropy values into distinctive groups.
Indeed, there is something credible. Blue dots in range of 5.0-5.5 are probably related to English text.
Yellow dots in 5.5-6 are MIPS code. A lot of green dots in 6.0-6.5 is the unknown second third.
Orange dots close to 8.0 are related to compressed JPEG file.
Other orange dots are probably related to the end of the firmware (unknown to us data).</p>

_HL2(`Conclusion')

<p>Information entropy can be used as a quick-n-dirty method for inspecting unknown binary files.
In particular, it is a very quick way to find compressed/encrypted pieces of data.
Someone say it's possible to find RSA (and other asymmetric cryptographic algorithms) public/private keys 
in executable code (which has high entropy as well), but I didn't tried this by myself.</p>

_HL2(`Links')

<p>There is a great (and more complex) online entropy visualizer made by Aldo Cortesi, 
which I tried to mimic: _HTML_LINK_AS_IS(`http://binvis.io').

_HL2(`A word about primitive encryption like XORing.')

<p>It's interesting that simple XOR encryption doesn't affect entropy of data.
I've shown this in "Norton Guide" example in my book (_HTML_LINK(`//beginners.re/',`"Reverse Engineering for Beginners" free book')).
(The page about XOR encryption is also accessible in LaTeX form: _HTML_LINK(`https://github.com/DennisYurichev/RE-for-beginners/blob/master/ff/XOR/ng/main.tex',`link').</p>

<p>Generalizing: encryption by substitution cipher also doesn't affect entropy of data (and XOR can be viewed as substitution cipher).
The reason of that is because entropy calculation algorithm view data on byte-level.
On the other hand, the data encrypted by 2 or 4-byte XOR pattern will result another entropy.</p>

_HL2(`More about entropy of executable code.')

<p>It is quickly noticeable that probably biggest source of high-entropy in executable code are relative offsets encoded in opcodes.
For example, these two consequent instructions will produce different relative offsets in their opcodes, 
while they are in fact pointing to the same function:</p>

_PRE_BEGIN
function proc
...
function endp

...

CALL function
...
CALL function
_PRE_END

<p>Ideal executable code compressor would encode information like this:
"there is a CALL to a "function" at address X and the same CALL at address Y" without need to encode
address of the "function" twice.</p>

<p>To deal with this, executable compressors are sometimes able to reduce entropy here.
One example is UPX: _HTML_LINK_AS_IS(`http://sourceforge.net/p/upx/code/ci/default/tree/doc/filter.txt').</p>

_HL2(`Random number generators')

<p>When I run GnuPG to generate new secret key, it asking for some entropy...</p>

_PRE_BEGIN
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Not enough random bytes available.  Please do some other work to give
the OS a chance to collect more entropy! (Need 169 more bytes)
_PRE_END

<p>This means that good a PRNG produces long high-entropy results, and this is what the secret assimetrical cryptographical key needs.
But _HTML_LINK(`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator',`cryptographically secure PRNG') is tricky 
(because computer is highly deterministic device itself),
so the GnuPG asking for some additional randomness from the user.</p>
